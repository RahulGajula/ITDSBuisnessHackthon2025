# 📊 Technical Project Overview

## 🛠 Problem Statement

Peterbilt Motors offers a wide range of truck configurations, making it challenging to identify factors that contribute to **higher warranty costs**.  

We were tasked with analyzing two datasets:
- **Truck Attributes**
- **Warranty Claims**

**Objectives:**
1. Identify attributes that drive warranty costs.
2. Understand how attribute combinations affect costs.
3. Develop predictive frameworks to minimize future costs.

## 🔎 Methodology

### 📋 Data Preparation
- Integrated and cleaned two datasets.
- Mapped warranty cost values to a numeric scale (Very Low = 1 to Very High = 5).

### 📊 Analytical Techniques
- **Kruskal-Wallis H-Test**: Identified significant individual attributes.
- **Interaction Term Analysis**: Evaluated impact of attribute pairs.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Built a predictive model for warranty costs.

### ⚙️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Scipy**: Statistical testing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib**: Data visualization

# 📈 Recommendations

Based on our findings, we proposed:

- **Attribute-Based Customization**: Minimize high-cost configurations by modifying critical attributes.
- **Predictive Modeling Deployment**: Use machine learning models to proactively identify risky configurations.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Update models and retrain as new warranty data becomes available.
